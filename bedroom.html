            <p class="discription">in general, a standard bedroom set consists of three to four pieces: the bed, a
                nightstand and a dresser. The fourth piece may be an additional nightstand or a mirror for the dresser.
                Standard sets are sold together and usually offer savings over buying pieces separately.
                <br> In addition to standard bedroom sets, some may be expanded to add an additional dresser, a bench
                and more. It’s sometimes possible to customize a set, meaning that you can pick and choose matching
                pieces so you get what you need. For example, if a tall, narrow dresser fits in your space better than a
                wide one, you could swap out one for the other..
